# Tab-Prosthesis-Analysis



In this project one can use simple code using standard library directly.

All details are attached in folder form in my repo.

Whole project report is also attached there one can take reference from that folder also.
Report contains every possible scenario and all procedures for project demonstrations as well.Hardware interfacing is also enlisted how they are working and those working details are also ennumerated.


But when we have to interface arduino with 'Brain Grapher' then another code will be used for which below metioned two libraries must be included.

VarSpeedServo.h
Brain.h

for this hardware interfacing is somewhat changed than the simple pulse based prosthesis.One can interface Neurosky Brain Grapher to Arduino uno by connecting the serial port [tx and rx] and ground of Brain Grapher to ground of Arduino uno.
